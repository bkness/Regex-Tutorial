# Regex Tutorial for Emails

"Hello World! Today, we're diving into the world of regular expressions. These little gems are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation, used by programmers, data analysts, and anyone eager to enhance their text-searching skills. With regex, we can describe intricate patterns in strings, making it a breeze to match, find, or replace specific sequences of characters. Throughout this tutorial, we'll disect those seemingly cryptic regex symbols and rules, breaking them down into easily digestible concepts. By the end, you'll have all the knowledge you need to seamlessly incorporate regex into your projects."

## Summary

This tutorial will explore a regular expression designed to validate email addresses. This regex ensures that an email follows a basic structure, checking for valid characters in the username, the domain, and the top-level domain. This pattern allows for flexibility and maintains the essential constraints. We'll break down the regex and explain each component, giving you the tools needed to modify your own regex expression based on your specific requirements 

Email Regex Code: ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are special characters that assert a position in a string. Instead of matching characters they define specific points in the text. Anchors are useful for recognizing patterns in certain positions within the string. 

### 1. Caret(^) - Start of Line Anchor:

<p><li>The caret asserts that the following pattern must occur at the beginning of a line.</li></p>

<li>Example: `^Hello` matches any string that starts with "Hello."</li>

### 2. Dollar Sign ($) - End of Line Anchor:

<p><li>The dollar sign asserts that the preceding pattern must occur at the end of a line.</li></p>

<li>Example: `$World` matches any string that ends with "World."</li>

### 3. Word Boundary (\b) - Word Boundary Anchor:

<p><li>The word boundary asserts that the pattern must occur at the beginning or end of a word.</li></p>

<li>Example: `\bword\b` matches "word" but not "subword" or "wording."</li>

### 4. Non-Word Boundary (\B) - Non-Word Boundary Anchor:

<p><li>The non-word boundary asserts that the pattern must not occur at a word boundary.</li></p>

<p><li>Example: `\Bword\B` matches "subword" but not "word" or "wording".</li></p>
